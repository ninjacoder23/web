   <pre style="position: relative;">Outer space (or simply space) is the expanse that exists beyond Earth's atmosphere and between celestial bodies.<br>
        It contains ultra-low levels of particle densities, constituting a near-perfect vacuum of predominantly hydrogen and helium plasma, permeated by electromagnetic radiation, cosmic rays, neutrinos,
         magnetic fields and dust. The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins (−270 °C; −455 °F).
Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above Earth's surface. The Kármán line, an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) above sea level,
is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping.
